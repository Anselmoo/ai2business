## About the `AI4Business`  <a name = "about"></a>

The idea behind `AI4Business` is to have a python package that bundles data scientist and project manager's daily routines. For our understanding, the daily routines start with gathering information, which derives from three independent sources:

- Search trends
- Research trends (coming soon ...)
- Market trends and tickers

The significant advantage is that `AI4Business` allows designing databases depending on individual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The following established method for data cleaning, data balancing, and data features selections is implemented and merged with automatic machine learning tools for classic and deep learning methods.

Finally, the results can be exported to database systems, MarkDown, EXCEL, and/or PowerPoint for generating a quick summary of a possible Proof of Concept (PoC). Moreover, `AI4Business` should build the input data (Keys) and the output data (Reports) into one transparent data unit to provide absolute business research traceability.
